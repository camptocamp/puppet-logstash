# Logstash Puppet Module

This module is provided by [Camptocamp](http://www.camptocamp.com/)

## Usage

The define type logstash::instance is used to declare one or more [logstash](http://logstash.net/) agents. The names of 
these agents doesn't matter. What is really important is the function of each of these agents 
which consists of specifying inputs, filters, and outputs

    include ::logstash

    logstash::instance{'shipper':
      ensure      => present,
      input_file  => 'puppet:///modules/.../shipper-input',
      filter_file => 'puppet:///modules/.../shipper-filter',
      output_file => 'puppet:///modules/.../shipper-output',
      java_opts   => '-Xms512m -Xmx512m',
    }

    logstash::instance {['indexer-a', 'indexer-b', 'indexer-c']:
      ensure      => present,
      input_file  => 'puppet:///modules/.../indexer-input',
      filter_file => 'puppet:///modules/.../indexer-filter',
      output_file => 'puppet:///modules/.../indexer-output',
      java_opts   => '-Xms1g -Xmx1g',
    }

## Package

Packages used by this module are simply built with [fpm] (https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm).

Download the all inclusive logstash jar in a basic structure:

    mkdir -p logstash-build/usr/share/logstash
    curl -o logstash-build/usr/share/logstash/logstash.jar http://semicomplete.com/files/logstash/logstash-1.1.9-flatjar.jar

Run the following command for CentOS/RedHat:

    fpm -s dir -t rpm -n logstash -v 1.1.9 -a noarch --iteration 1 -d "jre >= 1.6.0" -f -C logstash-build .

And this one for Debian/Ubuntu:

    fpm -s dir -t deb -n logstash -v 1.1.9 -a all --iteration 1 -d "java6-runtime" -f -C logstash-build .
